### Communication and Thought Process

Throughout the development of this full-stack application using **Next.js** for the frontend, **FastAPI** for the backend, and **PostgreSQL** as the database, my primary focus was on achieving a clear and efficient workflow while adhering to best coding practices. The project began with the requirement to create a frontend that dynamically loads and displays document data fetched from the API. Using Next.js, I leveraged its built-in support for server-side rendering and static site generation, which enhanced both performance and SEO.

For styling, I integrated **Tailwind CSS**, which provided a utility-first approach to CSS. This allowed me to create modular and reusable components, ensuring a consistent design across the application. With Tailwind CSS, I was able to rapidly develop and customize the UI, using utility classes to style elements directly in the markup. This approach significantly improved the maintainability of the styles, as components could easily be reused and modified without the need for extensive CSS files.

Initially, I set up the application to fetch document data from the FastAPI backend instead of relying on static JSON files. The documents are displayed as a grid of draggable cards, each styled using Tailwind CSS classes to ensure a modern and responsive layout. Each card is designed to show relevant document information, with a loading spinner for images to improve the user experience during loading. I implemented drag-and-drop functionality using the `react-dnd` library, which allowed users to reorder the cards intuitively. This feature was crucial for the user interface, adding a layer of interactivity and responsiveness that aligns with modern web application standards.

On the backend, I set up a **FastAPI** REST API to interact with a **PostgreSQL** database, utilizing **SQLAlchemy** as the ORM for data modeling. To manage database migrations, I incorporated **Alembic**, which allowed for smooth schema changes over time. I defined migration scripts to create a `documents` table in the database, capturing the necessary fields for each document. Additionally, I included a mechanism to insert the initial five records into the database when the API starts, ensuring that the application is ready for use without requiring any manual setup.

To optimize performance and minimize API calls, I designed the API to handle batch updates efficiently, allowing only changed documents to be sent to the server. This approach not only reduced the load on the backend but also improved the user experience by minimizing network usage.

A key decision in this project was to use **Docker** and **Docker Compose** for packaging the entire application. This choice facilitated easy deployment and startup of the application. By defining the services in a `docker-compose.yml` file, I ensured that both the frontend and backend services, along with the PostgreSQL database, could be started with a single command. This greatly simplified the development workflow and ensured consistency across different environments.

Additionally, I enabled automatic generation of API documentation using Swagger, which can be accessed at `http://localhost:8000/docs`. This interface allows developers to easily explore the available API endpoints, view request/response formats, and test the APIs directly from the browser.

Throughout the development process, I placed a strong emphasis on simplicity and clarity. I avoided adding unnecessary features and focused on fulfilling the project requirements directly. This principle guided my decisions, ensuring that the solution remained maintainable and straightforward. I utilized modern paradigms such as React Hooks within Next.js and Python's type hinting with Pydantic to enhance code readability and maintainability.

### How to Start the Application

To start the application, navigate to the project directory in your terminal and run the following command:

```bash
cd drag-drop-nextjs
docker-compose up --build
```

This command will build and start all the necessary services defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file, including the frontend, backend, and PostgreSQL database. Once the services are up and running, you can access the frontend application in your browser at `http://localhost:3000` (or the appropriate port specified in your configuration). Additionally, you can view the API documentation at `http://localhost:8000/docs`.
